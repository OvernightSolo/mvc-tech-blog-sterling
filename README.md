## Project Description

## Installation

If you would like to install this project on your local computer, make sure you have a database you can run the seeds into. Seeds are sample rows for each model (table), to give you some starter data. Reading the package.json will go a long ways, so of course, make sure you read the script and seeds code, as well as run an npm install. This project is hosted on Heroku and utilizes JawsDB. The .env is not uploaded to GitHub for security reasons, but to fully replicate this website on a cloud-based platform, you will need to generate a connection string in order to seed the data through a database on such a platform as Heroku. I did so from .env with JawsDB.
